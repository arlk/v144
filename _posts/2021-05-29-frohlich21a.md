title: Cautious Bayesian Optimization for Efficient and Scalable Policy Search
abstract: Sample efficiency is one of the key factors when applying policy search
  to real-world problems. In recent years, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has become prominent
  in the field of robotics due to its sample efficiency and little prior knowledge
  needed. However, one drawback of BO is its poor performance on high-dimensional
  search spaces as it focuses on global search. In the policy search setting, local
  optimization is typically sufficient as initial policies are often available, e.g.,
  via meta-learning, kinesthetic demonstrations or sim-to-real approaches. In this
  paper, we propose to constrain the policy search space to a sublevel-set of the
  Bayesian surrogate model’s predictive uncertainty. This simple yet effective way
  of constraining the policy update enables BO to scale to high-dimensional spaces
  (>100) as well as reduces the risk of damaging the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach on a wide range of problems, including a motor skills task, adapting
  deep RL agents to new reward signals and a sim-to-real task for an inverted pendulum
  system.
