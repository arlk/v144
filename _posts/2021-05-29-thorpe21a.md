title: Learning Approximate Forward Reachable Sets Using Separating Kernels
abstract: We present a data-driven method for computing approximate forward reachable
  sets using separating kernels in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We frame the
  problem as a support estimation problem, and learn a classifier of the support as
  an element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using a data-driven approach. Kernel
  methods provide a computationally efficient representation for the classifier that
  is the solution to a regularized least squares problem. The solution converges almost
  surely as the sample size increases, and admits known finite sample bounds. This
  approach is applicable to stochastic systems with arbitrary disturbances and neural
  network verification problems by treating the network as a dynamical system, or
  by considering neural network controllers as part of a closed-loop system. We present
  our technique on several examples, including a spacecraft rendezvous and docking
  problem, and two nonlinear system benchmarks with neural network controllers.
