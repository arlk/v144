title: Robust error bounds for quantised and pruned neural networks
abstract: A new focus in machine learning is concerned with understanding the issues
  faced with imple- menting neural networks on low-cost and memory-limited hardware,
  for example smart phones. This approach falls under the umbrella of “decentralised”
  learning and, compared to the “cen- tralised” case where data is collected and acted
  upon by a large server held offline, offers greater privacy protection and a faster
  reaction speed to incoming data . However, when neural networks are implemented
  on limited hardware there are no guarantees that their outputs will not be signifi-
  cantly corrupted. This problem is addressed in this talk where a semi-definite program
  is introduced to robustly bound the error induced by implementing neural networks
  on limited hardware. The method can be applied to generic neural networks and is
  able to account for the many nonlinearities of the problem. It is hoped that the
  computed bounds will give certainty to software/control/ML engineers implementing
  these algorithms efficiently on limited hardware.
