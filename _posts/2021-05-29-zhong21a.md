title: Benchmarking Energy-Conserving Neural Networks for Learning Dynamics from Data
abstract: 'The last few years have witnessed an increased interest in incorporatingÂ physics-informed
  inductive bias in deep learning frameworks. In particular, a growing volume of literature
  has been exploring ways to enforce energy conservation while using neural networks
  for learning dynamics from observed time-series data. In this work, we present a
  comparative analysis of the energy-conserving neural networks - for example, deep
  Lagrangian network, Hamiltonian neural network, etc. - wherein the underlying physics
  is encoded in their computation graph. We focus on ten neural network models and
  explain the similarities and differences between the models. We compare their performance
  in 4 different physical systems. Our result highlights that using a high-dimensional
  coordinate system and then imposing restrictions via explicit constraints can lead
  to higher accuracy in the learned dynamics. We also point out the possibility of
  leveraging some of these energy-conserving models to design energy-based controllers. '
