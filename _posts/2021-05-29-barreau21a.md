title: Learning-based State Reconstruction for a Scalar Hyperbolic PDE under noisy
  Lagrangian Sensing
abstract: The state reconstruction problem of a heterogeneous dynamic system under
  sporadic measurements is considered. This system consists of a conversation flow
  together with a multi-agent network modeling particles within the flow. We propose
  a partial-state reconstruction algorithm using physics-informed learning based on
  local measurements obtained from these agents. Traffic density reconstruction is
  used as an example to illustrate the results and it is shown that the approach provides
  an efficient noise rejection.
