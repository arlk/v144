title: Chance-constrained quasi-convex optimization with application to data-driven
  switched systems control
abstract: We study quasi-convex optimization problems, where only a subset of the
  constraints can be sampled, and yet one would like a probabilistic guarantee on
  the obtained solution with respect to the initial (unknown) optimization problem.
  Even though our results are partly applicable to general quasi-convex problems,
  in this work we introduce and study a particular subclass, which we call "quasi-linear
  problems". We provide optimality conditions for these problems. Thriving on this,
  we extend the approach of chance-constrained convex optimization to quasi-linear
  optimization problems. Finally, we show that this approach is useful for the stability
  analysis of black-box switched linear systems, from a finite set of sampled trajectories.
  It allows us to compute probabilistic upper bounds on the JSR of a large class of
  switched linear systems.
