title: Finite-time System Identification and Adaptive Control in Autoregressive Exogenous
  Systems
abstract: 'Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) systems are the general class of input-output
  dynamical system used for modeling stochastic linear dynamical system (LDS) including
  partially observable LDS such as LQG systems. In this work, we study the problem
  of system identification and adaptive control of unknown ARX systems. We provide
  finite-time learning guarantees for the ARX systems under both open-loop and closed-loop
  data collection. Using these guarantees, we design adaptive control algorithms for
  unknown ARX systems with arbitrary strongly convex or non-strongly convex quadratic
  regulating costs. Under strongly convex cost functions, we design an adaptive control
  algorithm based on online gradient descent to design and update the controllers
  that are constructed via a convex controller reparametrization. We show that our
  algorithm has $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret via explore and commit approach and if
  the model estimates are updated in epochs using closed-loop data collection, it
  attains the optimal regret of $\text{polylog}(T)$ after $T$ time-steps of interaction.
  For the case of non-strongly convex quadratic cost functions, we propose an adaptive
  control algorithm that deploys the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle
  to design the controller. In this setting, we show that the explore and commit approach
  has a regret upper bound of $\Tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, and the adaptive control with
  continuous model estimate updates attains $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret after $T$
  time-steps.  '
