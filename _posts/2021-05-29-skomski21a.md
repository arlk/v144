title: Automating Discovery of Physics-Informed Neural State Space Models via Learning
  and Evolution
abstract: 'Recent works exploring deep learning application to dynamical systems modeling
  have demonstrated that embedding physical priors into neural networks can yield
  more effective, physically-realistic, and data-efficient models. However, in the
  absence of complete prior knowledge of a dynamical system’s physical characteristics,
  determining the optimal structure and optimization strategy for these models can
  be difficult. In this work, we explore methods for discovering neural state space
  dynamics models for system identification. Starting with a design space of block-oriented
  state space models and structured linear maps with strong physical priors, we encode
  these components into a model genome alongside network structure, penalty constraints,
  and optimization hyperparameters. Demonstrating the overall utility of the design
  space, we employ an asynchronous genetic search algorithm that alternates between
  model selection and optimization and obtains accurate physically consistent models
  of three physical systems: an aerodynamics body, a continuous stirred tank reactor,
  and a two tank interacting system.'
