title: Neural Lyapunov Redesign
abstract: Learning controllers merely based on a performance metric has been proven
  effective in many physical and non-physical tasks in both control theory and reinforcement
  learning. However, in practice, the controller must guarantee some notion of safety
  to ensure that it does not harm either the agent or the environment. Stability is
  a crucial notion of safety, whose violation can certainly cause unsafe behaviors.
  Lyapunov functions are effective tools to assess stability in nonlinear dynamical
  systems. In this paper, we combine an improving Lyapunov function with automatic
  controller synthesis in an iterative fashion to obtain control policies with large
  safe regions. We propose a two-player collaborative algorithm that alternates between
  estimating a Lyapunov function and deriving a controller that gradually enlarges
  the stability region of the closed-loop system. We provide theoretical results on
  the class of systems that can be treated with the proposed algorithm and empirically
  evaluate the effectiveness of our method using an exemplary dynamical system.
