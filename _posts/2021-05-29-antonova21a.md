title: Sequential Topological Representations for Predictive Models of Deformable
  Objects
abstract: Deformable objects present a formidable challenge for robotic manipulation
  due to the lack of canonical low-dimensional representations and the difficulty
  of capturing, predicting, and controlling such objects. We construct compact topological
  representations to capture the state of highly deformable objects that are topologically
  nontrivial. We develop an approach that tracks the evolution of this topological
  state through time. Under several mild assumptions, we prove that the topology of
  the scene and its evolution can be recovered from point clouds representing the
  scene. Our further contribution is a method to learn predictive models that take
  a sequence of past point cloud observations as input and predict a sequence of topological
  states, conditioned on target/future control actions. Our experiments with highly
  deformable objects in simulation show that the proposed multistep predictive models
  yield more precise results that those obtained from computational topology libraries.
  These models can leverage patterns inferred across various objects and offer fast
  multistep predictions suitable for real-time applications.
