title: Maximum Likelihood Signal Matrix Model for Data-Driven Predictive Control
abstract: The paper presents a data-driven predictive control framework based on an
  implicit input-output mapping derived directly from the signal matrix of collected
  data. This signal matrix model is derived by maximum likelihood estimation with
  noise-corrupted data. By linearizing online, the implicit model can be used as a
  linear constraint to characterize possible trajectories of the system in receding
  horizon control. The signal matrix can also be updated online with new measurements.
  This algorithm can be applied to large datasets and slowly time-varying systems,
  possibly with high noise levels. An additional regularization term on the prediction
  error can be introduced to enhance the predictability and thus the control performance.
  Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed signal matrix model predictive control
  algorithm is effective in multiple applications and performs better than existing
  data-driven predictive control algorithm.
