title: Nonlinear Data-Enabled Prediction and Control
abstract: Behavioral theory, which characterizes linear dynamics with measured trajectories,
  has found successful applications in controller design and signal processing. However,
  the extension of behavioral theory to general nonlinear system remains an open question.
  In this work, we propose to apply behavioral theory to a reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space in order to extend its application to a class of nonlinear systems and we
  show its application in prediction and in predictive control.
