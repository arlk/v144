title: Nonlinear state-space identification using deep encoder networks
abstract: Nonlinear state-space identification for dynamical systems is most often
  performed by minimizing the simulation error to reduce the effect of model errors.
  This optimization problem becomes computationally expensive for large datasets.
  Moreover, the problem is also strongly non-convex, often leading to sub-optimal
  parameter estimates. This paper introduces a method that approximates the simulation
  loss by splitting the data set into multiple independent sections similar to the
  multiple shooting method. This splitting operation allows for the use of stochastic
  gradient optimization methods which scale well with data set size and has a smoothing
  effect on the non-convex cost function. The main contribution of this paper is the
  introduction of an encoder function to estimate the initial state at the start of
  each section. The encoder function estimates the initial states using a feed-forward
  neural network starting from historical input and output samples. The efficiency
  and performance of the proposed state-space encoder method is illustrated on two
  well-known benchmarks where, for instance, the method achieves the lowest known
  simulation error on the Wienerâ€“Hammerstein benchmark.
