title: Stable Online Control of Linear Time-Varying Systems
abstract: 'Linear time-varying (LTV) systems are widely used for modeling real-world
  dynamical systems due to their generality and simplicity. Providing stability guarantees
  for LTV systems is one of the central problems in control theory. However, existing
  approaches that guarantee stability typically lead to significantly sub-optimal
  cumulative control cost in online settings where only current or short-term system
  information is available. In this work, we propose an efficient online control algorithm,
  COvariance Constrained Online Linear Quadratic (COCO-LQ) control, that  guarantees
  input-to-state stability for a large class of LTV systems while also minimizing
  the control cost. The proposed method incorporates a state covariance constraint
  into the semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation of the LQ optimal controller.
  We empirically demonstrate the performance of COCO-LQ in both synthetic experiments
  and a power system frequency control example. '
