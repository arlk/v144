title: Control of Unknown (Linear) Systems with Receding Horizon Learning
abstract: A receding horizon learning scheme is proposed to transfer the state of
  a discrete-time dynamical control system to zero without the need of a system model.
  Global state convergence to zero is proved for the class of stabilizable and detectable
  linear time-invariant systems, assuming that only input and output data is available
  and an upper bound of the state dimension is known. The proposed scheme consists
  of a receding horizon control scheme and a proximity-based estimation scheme to
  estimate and control the closed-loop trajectory
