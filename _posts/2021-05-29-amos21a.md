title: On the Model-Based Stochastic Value Gradient for Continuous Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning approaches add explicit domain knowledge
  to agents in hopes of improving the sample-efficiency in comparison to model-free
  agents. However, in practice model-based methods are unable to achieve the same
  asymptotic performance on challenging continuous control tasks due to the complexity
  of learning and controlling an explicit world model. In this paper we investigate
  the stochastic value gradient (SVG),which is a well-known family of methods for
  controlling continuous systems which includes model-based approaches that distill
  a model-based value expansion into a model-free policy. We consider a variant of
  the model-based SVG that scales to larger systems and uses 1) an entropy regularization
  to help with exploration,2) a learned deterministic world model to improve the short-horizon
  value estimate, and 3) a learned model-free value estimate after the modelâ€™s rollout.
  This SVG variation captures the model-free soft actor-critic method as an instance
  when the model rollout horizon is zero,and otherwise uses short-horizon model rollouts
  to improve the value estimate for the policy update. We surpass the asymptotic performance
  of other model-based methods on the proprioceptive MuJoCo locomotion tasks from
  the OpenAI gym,including a humanoid. We notably achieve these results with a simple
  deterministic world model without requiring an ensemble.
