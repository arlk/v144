title: Safe Bayesian Optimisation for Controller Design by Utilising the Parameter
  Space Approach
abstract: As control systems become more and more complex, the optimal tuning of control
  parameters using Bayesian Optimisation gained an increased interest of research
  in recent years. Safe Bayesian Optimisation, tries to prevent sampling of unsafe
  parametrizations and therefore allow parameter tuning in real world experiments.
  Usually this is achieved by approximating a safe set using probabilistic GPR-predictions.
  In contrast in this work, analytical knowledge about robustly stable parameter configurations
  is gained by the parameter space approach and then incorporated within the optimisation
  as constraint. Simulation results on a linear system with uncertain parameters show
  a significant performance gain compared to standard approaches. .
