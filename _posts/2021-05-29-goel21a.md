title: Regret-optimal measurement-feedback control
abstract: We consider measurement-feedback control in linear dynamical systems from
  the perspective of regret minimization. Unlike most prior work in this area, we
  focus on the problem of designing an online controller which competes with the optimal
  dynamic sequence of control actions selected in hindsight, instead of the best controller
  in some specic class of controllers. This formulation of regret is attractive when
  the environment changes over time and no single controller achieves good performance
  over the entire time horizon. We show that in the measurement-feedback setting,
  unlike in the full-information setting, there is no single oine controller which
  outperforms every other oine controller on every disturbance, and propose a new
  H2-optimal oine controller as a benchmark for the online controller to compete against.
  We show that the corresponding regret-optimal online controller can be found via
  a novel reduction to the classical Nehari problem from robust control and present
  a tight data-dependent bound on its regret.
