title: 'SEAGuL: Sample Efficient Adversarially Guided Learning of Value Functions'
abstract: Value functions are powerful abstractions broadly used across optimal control
  and robotics algorithms. Several lines of work have attempted to leverage trajectory
  optimization to learn value function approximations, usually by solving a large
  number of trajectory optimization problems as a means to generate training data.
  Even though these methods point to a promising direction, for sufficiently complex
  tasks, their sampling requirements can become computationally intractable. In this
  work, we leverage insights from adversarial learning in order to improve the sampling
  efficiency of a simple value function learning algorithm. We demonstrate how generating
  adversarial samples for this task presents a unique challenge due to the loss function
  that does not admit a closed form expression of the samples, but that instead requires
  the solution to a nonlinear optimization problem. Our key insight is that by leveraging
  duality theory from optimization, it is still possible to compute adversarial samples
  for this learning problem with virtually no computational overhead, including without
  having to keep track of shifting distributions of approximation errors or having
  to train generative models. We apply our method, named SEAGuL, to a canonical control
  task (balancing the acrobot) and a more challenging and highly dynamic nonlinear
  control task (the perching of a small glider). We demonstrate that compared to random
  sampling, with the same number of samples, training value function approximations
  using SEAGuL leads to improved generalization errors that also translate to control
  performance improvement.
