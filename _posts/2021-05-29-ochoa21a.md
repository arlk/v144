title: Accelerated Concurrent Learning Algorithms via Data-Driven Hybrid Dynamics
  and Nonsmooth ODEs
abstract: We introduce a novel class of data-driven accelerated concurrent learning
  algorithms. Thesealgorithms are suitable for the solution of high-performance system
  identification and pa-rameter estimation problems withconvergence certificates,
  in settings where the standardpersistence of excitation (PE) condition is difficult
  to verifya  priori.  In order to achieve(uniform) fast convergence, the proposed
  algorithms exploit the existence of information-rich  data  sets,  as  well  as  certain  non-smooth  regularizations  that  generate  a  family  ofnon-Lipschitz
  dynamics modeled as data-driven ordinary differential equations (DD-ODEs)and/or
  data-driven hybrid dynamical systems (DD-HDS). In each case, we provide stabilityand
  convergence certificates via Lyapunov theory.  Moreover, to illustrate the advantages
  ofthe proposed algorithms, we consider an online estimation problem in Lithium-Ion
  batterieswhere the satisfaction of the PE condition is difficult to verify.
