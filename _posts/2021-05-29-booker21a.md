title: Learning to Actively Reduce Memory Requirements for Robot Control Tasks
abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensing modalities (e.g., RGB-D cameras) performing
  long-horizon tasks motivate the need for policies that are highly memory-efficient.
  State-of-the-art approaches for controlling robots often use memory representations
  that are excessively rich for the task or rely on handcrafted tricks for memory
  efficiency. Instead, this work provides a general approach for jointly synthesizing
  memory representations and policies; the resulting policies actively seek to reduce
  memory requirements. Specifically, we present a reinforcement learning framework
  that leverages an implementation of the group LASSO regularization to synthesize
  policies that employ low-dimensional and task-centric memory representations. We
  demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with simulated examples including navigation
  in discrete and continuous spaces as well as vision-based indoor navigation set
  in a photo-realistic simulator. The results on these examples indicate that our
  method is capable of finding policies that rely only on low-dimensional memory representations,
  improving generalization, and actively reducing memory requirements.
