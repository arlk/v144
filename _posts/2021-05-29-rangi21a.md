title: 'Learning based attacks in Cyber Physical Systems:  Exploration, Detection,
  and Control Cost trade-offs'
abstract: We study the problem of learning-based attacks in  linear   systems, where
  the communication channel between the controller and the plant can be hijacked by
  a malicious attacker.  We assume the attacker learns the dynamics of the system
  from observations, then  overrides the controllerâ€™s actuation signal, while mimicking
  legitimate operation by providing fictitious sensor readings  to the controller.  On
  the other hand, the controller is  on a lookout to detect the presence of the attacker
  and tries to  enhance the detection performance by carefully crafting its control
  signals.  We study the trade-offs between    the information acquired by the attacker
  from observations,  the detection capabilities of the controller, and the control
  cost. Specifically, we provide  tight upper and lower bounds on the expected $\epsilon$-deception
  time, namely the time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the
  presence of an attacker with confidence at least $(1-\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$.  We
  then show a probabilistic lower bound  on the time that must be spent by the attacker
  learning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected $\epsilon$-deception
  time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in the sense that   if the
  attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning algorithm with the given order
  expected deception time. Finally, we show a lower bound on the expected energy expenditure
  required to guarantee detection with confidence at least $1-\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon)$.
