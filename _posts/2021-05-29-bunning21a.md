title: Input Convex Neural Networks for Building MPC
abstract: Model Predictive Control in buildings can significantly reduce their energy
  consumption. The cost and effort necessary for creating and maintaining first principle
  models for buildings make data- driven modelling an attractive alternative in this
  domain. In MPC the models form the basis for an optimization problem whose solution
  provides the control signals to be applied to the system. The fact that this optimization
  problem has to be solved repeatedly in real-time implies restrictions on the learning
  architectures that can be used. Here, we adapt Input Convex Neural Networks that
  are generally only convex for one-step predictions, for use in building MPC. We
  introduce additional constraints to their structure and weights to achieve a convex
  input-output relationship for multi- step ahead predictions. We assess the consequences
  of the additional constraints for the model accuracy and test the models in a real-life
  MPC experiment in an apartment in Switzerland. In two five-day cooling experiments,
  MPC with Input Convex Neural Networks is able to keep room temperatures within comfort
  constraints while minimizing cooling energy consumption.
