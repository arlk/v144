title: A New Objective for Identification of Partially Observed Linear Time-Invariant
  Dynamical Systems from Input-Output Data
abstract: In this work we consider the identification of partially observed dynamical
  systems from a single trajectory of arbitrary input-output data. We propose a new
  optimization objective, derived as a MAP estimator of a certain posterior, that
  explicitly accounts for model, measurement, and parameter uncertainty. This algorithm
  identifies a linear time invariant model on a hidden latent space of pre-specified
  dimension. In contrast to Markov-parameter based least squares approaches, our algorithm
  can be applied to systems with arbitrary forcing and initial conditions, and we
  empirically show several magnitude improvement in prediction quality compared to
  state-of-the-art approaches on both linear and nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we
  theoretically demonstrate how these existing approaches can be derived from simplifying
  assumptions on our system that neglect the possibility of model errors.
