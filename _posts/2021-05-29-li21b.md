title: Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Robust Action Governor
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essentially a trial-and-error learning procedure
  which may cause unsafe behavior during the exploration-and-exploitation process.
  This hinders the application of RL to real-world control problems, especially to
  those for safety-critical systems. In this paper, we introduce a framework for safe
  RL that is based on integration of an RL algorithm with an add-on safety supervision
  module, called the Robust Action Governor (RAG), which exploits set-theoretic techniques
  and online optimization to manage safety-related requirements during learning. We
  illustrate this proposed safe RL framework through an application to automotive
  adaptive cruise control.
