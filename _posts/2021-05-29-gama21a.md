title: Graph Neural Networks for Distributed Linear-Quadratic Control
abstract: The linear-quadratic controller is one of the fundamental problems in control
  theory. The optimal solution is a linear controller that requires access to the
  state of the entire system at any given time. When considering a network system,
  this renders the optimal controller a centralized one. The interconnected nature
  of a network system often demands a distributed controller, where different components
  of the system are controlled based only on local information. Unlike the classical
  centralized case, obtaining the optimal distributed controller is usually an intractable
  problem. Thus, we adopt a graph neural network (GNN) as a parametrization of distributed
  controllers. GNNs are naturally local and have distributed architectures, making
  them well suited for learning nonlinear distributed controllers. By casting the
  linear-quadratic problem as a self-supervised learning problem, we are able to find
  the best GNN-based distributed controller. We also derive sufficient conditions
  for the resulting closed-loop system to be stable. We run extensive simulations
  to study the performance of GNN-based distributed controllers and showcase that
  they are a computationally efficient parametrization with scalability and transferability
  capabilities.
