title: ARDL - A Library for Adaptive Robotic Dynamics Learning
abstract: Dynamics learning and adaptive control algorithms have received a lack of
  support from robot dynamics libraries over the years. Only a few existing libraries
  like Pinocchio implement the standard regressor for basic model learning. In this
  work we introduce an open-source dynamics library specifically designed to provide
  support for dynamics learning and online adaptive control algorithms. Alongside
  established kinematics and dynamics computations, our new dynamics library provides
  computation for the standard, the Slotine-Li and the filtered regressor matrices
  found in adaptive control algorithms. We demonstrate the library through several
  existing adaptive control algorithms, alongside a new online simultaneous Semi-Parametric
  model using a Radial Basis Function Neural Network augmented with a newly derived
  consistency transform.
