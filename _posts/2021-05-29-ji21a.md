title: Learning the Dynamics of Time Delay Systems with Trainable Delays
abstract: In this paper, we propose a delay learning algorithm for time delay neural
  networks (TDNNs) based on mini-batch gradient descent. We show that the proposed
  algorithm is suitable for learning the dynamics of nonlinear time delay systems
  using TDNNs with trainable delays. The delays are introduced in the input layer
  and are learned with the same approach as weights and biases. The learned delays
  are easy to interpret and they are not restricted to discrete values. We demonstrate
  the method with an example of learning the dynamics of an autonomous time delay
  system. We show the performance of two proposed network architectures with trainable
  delays and compare it to a standard TDNN which has a large number of fixed (non-trainable)
  input delays. We demonstrate that the networks with trainable input delays achieve
  significantly better performance in closed-loop simulations compared to the standard
  TDNN. We also highlight that possible undesired local minima may be caused by the
  delays in the networks.
