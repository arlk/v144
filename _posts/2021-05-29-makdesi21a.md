title: Data-Driven Abstraction of Monotone Systems
abstract: In this paper, we introduce an approach for data-driven abstraction of monotone
  dynamical systems. First, we present an approach to find the optimal approximation
  of the dynamics of an unknown system by a set-valued map based on a set of transitions
  generated by the system. Then we show that the dynamical system induced by the introduced
  map is equivalent (in the sense of alternating bisimulation) to a finite state transition
  system which can be used to synthesize controllers using the well-established symbolic
  control techniques. We show the effectiveness of the approach on a safety controller
  synthesis problem.
