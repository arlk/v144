title: 'Feedback from Pixels: Output Regulation via Learning-based Scene View Synthesis'
abstract: We propose a novel controller synthesis involving feedback from pixels,
  whereby the measurement is a high dimensional signal representing a pixelated image
  with Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values. The approach neither requires feature extraction,
  nor object detection, nor visual correspondence. The control policy does not involve
  the estimation of states or similar latent representations. Instead, tracking is
  achieved directly in image space, with a model of the reference signal embedded
  as required by the internal model principle. The reference signal is generated by
  a neural network with learning-based scene view synthesis capabilities. Our approach
  does not require an end-to-end learning of a pixel-to-action control policy. The
  approach is applied to a motion control problem, namely the longitudinal dynamics
  of a car-following problem. We show how this approach lend itself to a tractable
  stability analysis with associated bounds critical to establishing trustworthiness
  and interpretability of the closed-loop dynamics.
