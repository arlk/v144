title: Bridging Physics-based and Data-driven modeling for Learning Dynamical Systems
abstract: How can we learn a dynamical system to make forecasts, when some variables
  are unobserved? For instance, in COVID-19, we want to forecast the number of infected
  patients and death cases but we do not know the count of susceptible and exposed
  people. How to proceed? While mechanics compartment models are widely-used in epidemic
  modeling, data-driven models are emerging for disease forecasting. As a case study,
  we compare these two types of models for COVID-19 forecasting and notice that physics-based
  models significantly outperform deep learning models. We present a hybrid approach,
  AutoODE-COVID, which combines a novel compartmental model with automatic differentiation.  Our
  method obtains a 57.4% reduction in mean absolute errors of the 7-day ahead COVID-19
  trajectories prediction compared with the best deep learning competitor. To understand
  the inferior performance of deep learning, we investigate the generalization problem
  in forecasting. Through systematic experiments, we found that deep learning models
  fail to forecast under shifted distributions either in the data and parameter domains
  of dynamical systems.  This calls attention to rethink generalization especially
  for learning dynamical systems.
