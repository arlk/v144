title: Learning Finite-Dimensional Representations For Koopman Operators
abstract: In this work, the problem of learning Koopman operator of a discrete-time
  autonomous system is considered. The learning problem is formulated as a constrained
  regularized optimization over the infinite-dimensional space of linear operators.
  We show that under certain but general conditions, a representer theorem holds for
  the learning problem. This allows reformulating the problem in a finite-dimensional
  space without loss of any precision. Following this, we consider various cases of
  regularization and constraint for the latent Koopman operator including the operator
  norm, the Frobenius norm, and rank. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding finite-dimensional
  problem.
