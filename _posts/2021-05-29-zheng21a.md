title: Safe Reinforcement Learning of Control-Affine Systems with Vertex Networks
abstract: This paper focuses on finding reinforcement learning policies for control
  systems with hard state and action constraints. Despite its success in many domains,
  reinforcement learning is challenging to apply to problems with hard constraints,
  especially if both the state variables and actions are constrained. Previous works
  seeking to ensure constraint satisfaction, or safety, have focused on adding a projection
  step to the policy during learning. Yet, this approach requires solving an optimization
  problem at every policy execution step, which can lead to significant computational
  costs and has no safety guarantee with the projection step removed after training.
  To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new approach, termed Vertex Networks
  (VNs), with guarantees on safety during both the exploration and execution stage,
  by incorporating the safety constraints into the policy network architecture. Leveraging
  the geometric property that all points within a convex set can be represented as
  the convex combination of its vertices, the proposed algorithm first learns the
  convex combination weights and then uses these weights along with the pre-calculated
  vertices to output an action. The output action is guaranteed to be safe by construction.
  Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed VN algorithm outperforms projection-based
  reinforcement learning methods.
