title: Learning Visually Guided Latent Actions for Assistive Teleoperation
abstract: 'It is challenging for humans — particularly people living with physical
  disabilities — to control high-dimensional and dexterous robots. Prior work explores
  how robots can learn embedding functions that map a human’s low-dimensional inputs
  (e.g., via a joystick) to complex, high-dimensional robot actions for assistive
  teleoperation; unfortunately, there are many more high-dimensional actions than
  available low-dimensional inputs! To extract the correct action and maximally assist
  their human controller, robots must reason over their current context: for example,
  pressing a joystick right when interacting with a coffee cup indicates a different
  action than when interacting with food. In this work, we develop assistive robots
  that condition their latent embeddings on visual inputs. We explore a spectrum of
  plausible visual encoders and show that incorporating object detectors pretrained
  on a small amount of cheap and easy-to-collect structured data enables i) accurately
  and robustly recognizing the current context and ii) generalizing control embeddings
  to new objects and tasks. In user studies with a high-dimensional physical robot
  arm, participants leverage this approach to perform new tasks with unseen objects.
  Our results indicate that structured visual representations improves few-shot performance
  and is subjectively preferred by users.'
