title: Stability and Identification of Random Asynchronous Linear Time-Invariant Systems
abstract: In many computational tasks and dynamical systems, asynchrony and randomization
  are naturally present and have been considered as ways to increase the speed and
  reduce the cost of computation while compromising the accuracy and convergence rate.
  In this work, we show the additional benefits of randomization and asynchrony on
  the stability of linear dynamical systems. We introduce a natural model for random
  asynchronous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems which generalizes the standard
  (synchronous) LTI systems. In this model, each state variable is updated randomly
  and asynchronously with some probability according to the underlying system dynamics.
  We examine how the mean-square stability of random asynchronous LTI systems vary
  with respect to randomization and asynchrony. Surprisingly, we show that the stability
  of random asynchronous LTI systems does not imply or is not implied by the stability
  of the synchronous variant of the system and an unstable synchronous system can
  be stabilized via randomization and/or asynchrony. We further study a special case
  of the introduced model, namely randomized LTI systems, where each state element
  is updated randomly with some fixed but unknown probability. We consider the problem
  of system identification of unknown randomized LTI systems using the precise characterization
  of mean-square stability via extended Lyapunov equation. For unknown randomized
  LTI systems, we propose a systematic identification method to recover the underlying
  dynamics. Given a single input/output trajectory, our method estimates the model
  parameters that govern the system dynamics, the update probability of state variables,
  and the noise covariance using the correlation matrices of collected data and the
  extended Lyapunov equation. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed
  method consistently recovers the underlying system dynamics with optimal rate.
