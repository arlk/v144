title: Certainty Equivalent Perception-Based Control
abstract: In order to certify performance and safety, feedback control requires precise
  characterization of sensor errors. In this paper, we provide guarantees on such
  feedback systems when sensors are characterized by solving a supervised learning
  problem. We show a uniform error bound on nonparametric kernel regression under
  a dynamically-achievable dense sampling scheme. This allows for a finite-time convergence
  rate on the sub-optimality of using the regressor in closed-loop for waypoint tracking.
  We demonstrate our results in simulation with simplified unmanned aerial vehicle
  and autonomous driving examples.
