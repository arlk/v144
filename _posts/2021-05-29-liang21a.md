title: Self-Supervised Learning of Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks with Finite-State
  Task Machines
abstract: We consider the problem of a robot learning to manipulate unknown objects
  while using them to perform a complex task that is composed of several sub-tasks.
  The robot receives 6D poses of the objects along with their semantic labels, and
  executes nonprehensile actions on them. The robot does not receive any feedback
  regarding the task until the end of an episode, where a binary reward indicates
  success or failure in performing the task. Moreover, certain attributes of objects
  cannot be always observed, so the robot needs to learn to remember pertinent past
  actions that it executed. We propose to solve this problem by simultaneously learning
  a low-level control policy and a high-level finite-state task machine that keeps
  track of the progress made by the robot in solving the various sub-tasks and guides
  the low-level policy. Several experiments in simulation clearly show that the proposed
  approach is efficient at solving complex robotic tasks without any supervision.
