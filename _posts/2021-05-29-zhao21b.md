title: Primal-dual Learning for the Model-free Risk-constrained Linear Quadratic Regulator
abstract: Risk-aware control, though with promise to tackle unexpected events, requires
  a known exact dynamical model. In this work, we propose a model-free framework to
  learn a risk-aware controller of a linear system. We formulate it as a discrete-time
  infinite-horizon LQR problem with a state predictive variance constraint. Since
  its optimal policy is known as an affine feedback, i.e., $u^* = -Kx+l$, we alternatively
  optimize the gain pair $(K,l)$ by designing a primal-dual learning algorithm. First,
  we observe that the Lagrangian function enjoys an important local gradient dominance
  property. Based on it, we then show that there is no duality gap despite the non-convex
  optimization landscape. Furthermore, we propose a primal-dual algorithm with global
  convergence to learn the optimal policy-multiplier pair. Finally, we validate our
  results via simulations.
