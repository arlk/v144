title: Regret Bounds for Adaptive Nonlinear Control
abstract: We study the problem of adaptively controlling a known discrete-time nonlinear
  system subject to unmodeled disturbances. We prove the first finite-time regret
  bounds for adaptive nonlinear control with matched uncertainty in the stochastic
  setting, showing that the regret suffered by certainty equivalence adaptive control,
  compared to an oracle controller with perfect knowledge of the un-modeled disturbances,
  is upper bounded by $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in expectation. Furthermore, we show
  that when the input is subject to a k timestep delay, the regret degrades to $\widetilde{O}(k\sqrt{T})$.   Our
  analysis draws connections between classical stability notions in nonlinear control
  theory (Lyapunov stability and contraction theory) and modern regret analysis from
  online convex optimization. The use of stability theory allows us to analyze the
  challenging infinite-horizon single trajectory setting.
