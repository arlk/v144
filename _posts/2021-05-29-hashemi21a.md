title: Certifying Incremental Quadratic Constraints for Neural Networks via Convex
  Optimization
abstract: Abstracting neural networks with constraints they impose on their inputs
  and outputs can be very useful in the analysis of neural network classifiers and
  to derive optimization-based algorithms for certification of stability and robustness
  of feedback systems involving neural networks. In this paper, we propose a convex
  program, in the form of a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI), to certify quadratic bounds
  on the map of neural networks over a region of interest. These certificates can
  capture several useful properties such as (local) Lipschitz continuity, one-sided
  Lipschitz continuity, invertibility, and contraction. We illustrate the utility
  of our approach in two different settings. First, we develop a semidefinite program
  to compute guaranteed and sharp upper bounds on the local Lipschitz constant of
  neural networks and illustrate the results on random networks as well as networks
  trained on MNIST. Second, we consider a linear time-invariant system in feedback
  with an approximate model predictive controller given by a neural network. We then
  turn the stability analysis into a semidefinite feasibility program and estimate
  an ellipsoidal invariant set for the closed-loop system.
