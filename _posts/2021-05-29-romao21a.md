title: Tight sampling and discarding bounds for scenario programs with an arbitrary
  number of removed samples
abstract: The so-called scenario approach offers an efficient framework to address
  uncertain optimisation problems with uncertainty represented by means of scenarios.
  The sampling-and-discarding approach within the scenario approach literature allows
  the decision maker to trade feasibility to performance. We focus on a removal scheme
  composed by a cascade of scenario programs that removes at each stage a superset
  of the support set associated to the optimal solution of each of these programs.
  This particular removal scheme yields a scenario solution with tight guarantees
  on the probability of constraint violation; however, existing analysis restricts
  the number of discarded scenarios to be a multiple of the dimension of the optimisation
  problem. Motivated by this fact, this paper presents pathways to extend the theoretical
  analysis of this removal scheme. We first provide an extension for a restricted
  class of scenarios programs for which tight bounds can be obtained, and then we
  provide a conservative bound on the probability of constraint violation that is
  valid for any scenario program and an arbitrary number of removed scenarios, which
  is, however, not tight.
