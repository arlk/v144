title: Suboptimal coverings for continuous spaces of control tasks
abstract: We propose the Î±-suboptimal covering number to characterize multi-task control
  problems where the set of dynamical systems and/or cost functions is infinite, analogous
  to the cardinality of finite task sets.  This notion may help quantify the function
  class expressiveness needed to represent a good multi-task policy, which is important
  for learning-based control methods that use parameterized function approximation.  We
  study suboptimal covering numbers for linear dynamical systems with quadratic cost
  (LQR problems) and construct a class of multi-task LQR problems amenable to analysis.  For
  the scalar case, we show logarithmic dependence on the "breadth" of the space.  For
  the matrix case, we present experiments 1) measuring the efficiency of a particular
  constructive cover, and 2) visualizing the behavior of two candidate systems for
  the lower bound.
