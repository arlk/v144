title: 'Robust Reinforcement Learning: A Constrained Game-theoretic Approach'
abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods provide state-of-art performance
  in complex control tasks. However, it has been widely recognized that RL methods
  often fail to generalize due to unaccounted uncertainties. In this work, we propose
  a game theoretic framework for robust reinforcement learning that comprises many
  previous works as special cases. We formulate robust RL as a constrained minimax
  game between the RL agent and an environmental agent which represents uncertainties
  such as model parameter variations and adversarial disturbances. To solve the competitive
  optimization problems arising in our framework, we propose to use competitive mirror
  descent (CMD). This method accounts for the interactive nature of the game at each
  iteration while using Bregman divergences to adapt to the global structure of the
  constraint set. We demonstrate an RRL policy gradient algorithm that leverages Lagrangian
  duality and CMD. We empirically show that our algorithm is stable for large step
  sizes, resulting in faster convergence on linear quadratic games. '
