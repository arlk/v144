title: 'Approximate Distributionally Robust Nonlinear Optimization with Application
  to Model Predictive Control: A Functional Approach'
abstract: We provide a functional view of distributional robustness motivated by robust
  statistics and functional analysis. This results in two practical computational
  approaches for approximate distribution-ally robust nonlinear optimization based
  on gradient norms and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our method can be applied
  to the settings of statistical learning with small sample size and test distribution
  shift. As a case study, we robustify scenario-based stochastic model predictive
  control with general nonlinear constraints.  In particular, we demonstrate constraint
  satisfaction with only a small number of scenarios under distribution shift.
