title: Forced Variational Integrator Networks for Prediction and Control of Mechanical
  Systems
abstract: As deep learning becomes more prevalent for prediction and control of real
  physical systems, it is important that these models are consistent with physically
  plausible dynamics. This elicits a problem with how much inductive bias to impose
  on the model through known physical parameters and principles to reduce complexity
  of the learning problem to give us more reliable predictions. Recent work employs
  discrete variational integrators parameterized as a neural network architecture
  to learn conservative Lagrangian systems. The learned model captures and enforces
  global energy preserving properties of the system from very few trajectories. However,
  most real systems are inherently non-conservative and, in practice, we would also
  like to apply actuation. In this paper we extend this paradigm to account for general
  forcing (e.g. control input and friction) via discrete D’Alembert’s principle which
  may ultimately be used for control applications. We show that this forced variational
  integrator networks (FVIN) architecture allows us to accurately account for energy
  dissipation and external forcing while still capturing the true underlying energy-based
  passive dynamics. We show that in application this can result in highly-data efficient
  model-based control and can predict on real non-conservative systems.
