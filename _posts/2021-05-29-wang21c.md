title: Domain Adaptation Using System Invariant Dynamics Models
abstract: Reinforcement learning requires large amounts of training data. For many
  systems, especially mobile robots, collecting this training data can be expensive
  and time consuming. We propose a novel domain adaptation method to reduce the amount
  of training data needed for model-based reinforcement learning methods to train
  policies for a target system. Using our method, the required amount of target system
  training data can be reduced by collecting data on a proxy system with similar,
  but not identical, dynamics on which training data is cheaper to collect. Our method
  models the underlying dynamics shared between the two systems using a System Invariant
  Dynamics Model (SIDM), and models each systemâ€™s relationship to the SIDM using encoders
  and decoders. When only limited amounts of target system training data is available,
  using target and proxy data to train the SIDM, encoders, and decoders can lead to
  more accurate dynamics models for the target system than using target system data
  alone. We demonstrate this approach using simulated wheeled robots driving over
  rough terrain, varying dynamics parameters between the target and proxy system,
  and find a reduction of 5-20x in the amount of data needed for these systems.
