title: Uncertain-aware Safe Exploratory Planning using Gaussian Process and Neural
  Control Contraction Metric
abstract: 'Robots operating in unstructured, complex, and changing real-world environments
  should navigate and maintain safety while collecting data about its environment
  and updating its model dynamics. In this paper, we consider the problem of using
  a robot to explore an environment with an unknown, state-dependent disturbance to
  the dynamics and forbidden areas. The goal of the robot is to safely collect observations
  on the disturbance and construct an accurate estimate of the underlying function.
  We use Gaussian process to get an estimate of the disturbance from data with a high-confidence
  bound on the regression error. Furthermore, we use neural contraction metrics to
  derive a tracking controller and the corresponding high-confidence uncertainty tube
  around the nominal trajectory planned for the robot, based on the estimate of the
  disturbance. From the robustness of the Contraction Metric, error bound can be pre-computed
  and used by the motion planner such that the actual trajectory is guaranteed to
  be safe. '
