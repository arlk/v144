title: A Data Driven, Convex Optimization Approach to Learning Koopman Operators
abstract: Koopman operators provide tractable means of learning linear approximations
  of  non-linear dynamics. Many approaches have been proposed to find these operators,  typically  based
  upon approximations using an a-priori fixed  class of models. However, choosing
  appropriate models and bounding the approximation error is far from trivial.   Motivated
  by these difficulties, in this paper we propose an optimization based approach to  learning  Koopman
  operators from data. Our results show that the Koopman operator, the associated
  Hilbert space of observables and a suitable dictionary can be obtained by solving
  two rank-constrained semi-definite programs (SDP). While in principle these problems
  are NP-hard, the use of standard relaxations of rank leads to  convex SDPs.
