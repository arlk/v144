title: Traffic Forecasting using Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication
abstract: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is utilized in order to provide real-time
  on-board traffic predictions. A hybrid approach is proposed where physics based
  models are supplemented with deep learning. A recurrent neural network is used to
  improve the accuracy of predictions given by first principle models. Our hybrid
  model is able to predict the velocity of individual vehicles up to 40 seconds into
  the future with improved accuracy over physics based baselines. A comprehensive
  study is conducted to evaluate different methods of integrating physics with deep
  learning.
