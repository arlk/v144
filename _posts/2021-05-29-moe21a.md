title: 'Decoupling dynamics and sampling:  RNNs for unevenly sampled data and flexible
  online predictions'
abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) incorporate a memory state which makes
  them suitable for time series analysis. The Linear Antisymmetric RNN (LARNN) is
  a previously suggested recurrent layer which is proven to ensure long-term memory
  using a simple structure without gating. The LARNN is based on an ordinary differential
  equation which is solved using numerical methods with a defined step size variable.
  In this paper, this step size is related to the sampling frequency of the data used
  for training and testing of the models. In particular, industrial datasets often
  consist of measurements that are sampled and analyzed manually or sampled only for
  sufficiently large change. This is usually handled by resampling and performing
  some kind of interpolation to gain a dataset with evenly sampled data. However,
  in doing so, one has to apply several assumption regarding the nature of the data
  (e.g. linear interpolation) and valuable information about the dynamics captured
  by the actual sampling is lost. Furthermore, interpolation is non-causal by nature,
  and thus poses a challenge in an online setting as future values are not known.
  By using information about sampling time in the LARNN structure, interpolation is
  obsolete as the model decouples the dynamics of the sampled system from the sampling
  regime. Furthermore, the suggested structure enables predictions related to specific
  times in the future, resulting in updated predictions regardless of whether new
  measurements are available. The performance of the LARNN is compared to an LSTM
  on a simulated industrial benchmark system.
