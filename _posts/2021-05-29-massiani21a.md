title: On exploration requirements for learning safety constraints
abstract: Safety is particularly challenging for dynamical systems since it requires
  constraint satisfaction along trajectory predictions. Equivalent control constraints
  for feedback control can be computed in the form of maximal positive invariant sets,
  but they are typically very computationally demanding and sensitive to model uncertainty,
  even for offline analysis. Recent work has explored learning such constraints directly
  from data, but currently either require extensive domain knowledge, or suffers from
  data-inefficiency. We propose a model-free exploration strategy to learn these constraints
  only where relevant for a nominal control policy, instead of for the whole state-action
  space. Our exploration strategy results from an analysis of the minimum convergence
  requirements, which it prioritizes, and is on-policy, which allows it to be directly
  applied to existing learning schemes.
