title: Learning How to Solve “Bubble Ball”
abstract: "“Bubble Ball” is a game built on a 2D physics engine, where a finite set
  of objects can modify the motion of a bubble-like ball. The objective is to choose
  the set and the initial configuration of the objects, in order to get the ball to
  reach a target flag.  The presence of obstacles, friction, contact forces and combinatorial
  object choices make the game hard to solve. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
  predictive framework which solves Bubble Ball. Geometric, kinematic and dynamic
  models are used at different levels of the hierarchy. At each level of the game,
  data collected during failed iterations are used to update models at all hierarchical
  level and converge to a feasible solution to the game. The proposed approach successfully
  solves a large set of Bubble Ball levels within reason-able number of trials. This
  proposed framework can also be used to solve other physics-based games, especially
  with limited training data from human demonstrations."
