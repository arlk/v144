title: Learning Stabilizing Controllers for Unstable Linear Quadratic Regulators from
  a Single Trajectory
abstract: The principal task to control dynamical systems is to ensure their stability.
  When the system is unknown, robust approaches are promising since they aim to stabilize
  a large set of plausible systems simultaneously. We study linear controllers under
  quadratic costs model also known as linear quadratic regulators (LQR). We present
  two different semi-definite programs (SDP) which results in a controller that stabilizes
  all systems within an ellipsoid uncertainty set. We further show that the feasibility
  conditions of the proposed SDPs are \emph{equivalent}. Using the derived robust
  controller syntheses, we propose an efficient data dependent algorithm – \textsc{eXploration}
  – that with high probability quickly identifies a stabilizing controller. Our approach
  can be used to initialize existing algorithms that require a stabilizing controller
  as an input while adding constant to the regret. We further propose different heuristics
  which empirically reduce the number of steps taken by \textsc{eXploration} and reduce
  the suffered cost while searching for a stabilizing controller.
