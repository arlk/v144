title: Optimal Algorithms for Submodular Maximization with Distributed Constraints
abstract: We consider a class of discrete optimization problems that aim to maximize
  a submodular objective function subject to a distributed partition matroid constraint.  More
  precisely, we consider a networked scenario in which multiple agents choose actions
  from local strategy sets with the goal of maximizing a submodular objective function
  defined over the set of all possible actions.  Given this distributed setting, we
  develop Constraint-Distributed Continuous Greedy (CDCG), a message passing algorithm
  that converges to the tight (1-1/e) approximation factor of the optimum global solution
  using only local computation and communication. It is known that a sequential greedy
  algorithm can only achieve a 1/2 multiplicative approximation of the optimal solution
  for this class of problems in the distributed setting. Our framework relies on lifting
  the discrete problem to a continuous domain and developing a consensus algorithm
  that achieves the tight (1-1/e) approximation guarantee of the global discrete solution
  once a proper rounding scheme is applied.  We also offer empirical results from
  a multi-agent area coverage problem to show that the proposed method significantly
  outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential greedy method.
