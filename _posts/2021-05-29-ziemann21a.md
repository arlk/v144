title: On Uninformative Optimal Policies in Adaptive LQR with Unknown B-Matrix
abstract: This paper presents local  asymptotic minimax regret lower bounds for adaptive
  Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). We consider affinely parametrized B-matrices
  and known A-matrices and aim to understand when logarithmic regret is impossible
  even in the presence of structural side information. After defining the intrinsic
  notion of an uninformative optimal policy in terms of a singularity condition for
  Fisher information we obtain local minimax regret lower bounds for such uninformative
  instances of LQR by appealing to van Trees’ inequality (Bayesian Cramér-Rao) and
  a representation of regret in terms of a quadratic form (Bellman error). It is shown
  that if the parametrization induces an uninformative optimal policy, logarithmic
  regret is impossible and the rate is at least order square root in the time horizon.
  We explicitly characterize the notion of an uninformative optimal policy in terms
  of the nullspaces of system-theoretic quantities and the particular instance parametrization.
