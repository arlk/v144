title: 'Nested Mixture of Experts: Cooperative and Competitive Learning of Hybrid
  Dynamical System'
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms can attain significant
  sample efficiency but require an appropriate network structure to represent system
  dynamics. Current approaches include white-box modeling using analytic parameterizations
  and black-box modeling using deep neural networks. However, both can suffer from
  a bias-variance trade-off in the learning process, and neither provides a structured
  method for injecting domain knowledge into the network. As an alternative, gray-box
  modeling leverages prior knowledge in neural network training but only for simple
  systems. In this paper, we devise a nested mixture of experts (NMOE) for representing
  and learning hybrid dynamical systems. An NMOE combines both white-box and black-box
  models while optimizing bias-variance trade-off. Moreover, an NMOE provides a structured
  method for incorporating various types of prior knowledge by training the associative
  experts cooperatively or competitively. The prior knowledge includes information
  on robotsâ€™ physical contacts with the environments as well as their kinematic and
  dynamic properties. In this paper, we demonstrate how to incorporate prior knowledge
  into our NMOE in various continuous control domains, including hybrid dynamical
  systems. We also show the effectiveness of our method in terms of data-efficiency,
  generalization to unseen data, and bias-variance trade-off. Finally, we evaluate
  our NMOE using an MBRL setup, where the model is integrated with a model-based controller
  and trained online.
