title: Physics-penalised Regularisation for Learning Dynamics Models with Contact
abstract: Robotic systems, such as legged robots and manipulators, often handle states
  which involve ground impact or interaction with objects present in their surroundings;
  both of which are physically driven by contact. Dynamics model learning tends to
  focus on continuous motion, yielding poor results when deployed on real systems
  exposed to non-smooth frictional discontinuities. Inspired by a recent promising
  direction in machine learning, in this work we present a novel method for learning
  dynamics models undergoing contact by augmenting data-driven deep models with physics-penalised
  regularisation. Precisely, this paper conceptually formalises a novel framework
  for using an impenetrability component in the physics-based loss function directly
  within the learning objective of neural networks. Our results demonstrate that our
  method shows superior performance to using normal deep models for learning non-smooth
  dynamics models of robotic manipulators, strengthening their potential for deployment
  in contact-rich environments.
