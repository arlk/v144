title: Abstraction-based branch and bound approach to Q-learning for hybrid optimal
  control
abstract: In this paper, we design a theoretical framework allowing to apply model
  predictive control on hybrid systems. For this, we develop a theory of approximate
  dynamic programming by leveraging the concept of alternating simulation. We show
  how to combine these notions in a branch and bound algorithm that can further refine
  the Q-functions using Lagrangian duality. We illustrate the approach on a numerical
  example.
