title: Accelerated Learning with Robustness to Adversarial Regressors
abstract: High order momentum-based parameter update algorithms have seen widespread
  applications in training machine learning models. Recently, connections with variational
  approaches have led to the derivation of new learning algorithms with accelerated
  learning guarantees. Such methods however, have only considered the case of static
  regressors. There is a significant need for parameter update algorithms which can
  be proven stable in the presence of adversarial time-varying regressors, as is commonplace
  in control theory. In this paper, we propose a new discrete time algorithm which
  1) provides stability and asymptotic convergence guarantees in the presence of adversarial
  regressors by leveraging insights from \emph{adaptive control theory} and 2) provides
  non-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees leveraging insights from convex optimization.
  In particular, our algorithm reaches an $\epsilon$ sub-optimal point in at most
  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iterations when regressors are constant
  - matching lower bounds due to Nesterov of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$, up to a
  $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor and provides guaranteed bounds for stability when regressors
  are time-varying. We provide numerical experiments for a variant of Nesterov’s provably
  hard convex optimization problem with time-varying regressors, as well as the problem
  of recovering an image with a time-varying blur and noise using streaming data.
