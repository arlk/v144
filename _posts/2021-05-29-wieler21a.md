title: Data-Driven Controller Design via Finite-Horizon Dissipativity
abstract: Given a single measured trajectory of a discrete-time linear time-invariant
  system, we present a framework for data-driven controller design for closed-loop
  finite-horizon dissipativity. First we parametrize all closed-loop trajectories
  using the given data of the plant and a model of the controller. We then provide
  an approach to validate the controller by verifying closed-loop dissipativity in
  the standard feedback loop based on this parametrization. The developed conditions
  allow us to state the corresponding controller synthesis problem as a quadratic
  matrix inequality feasibility problem. Hence, we obtain purely data-driven synthesis
  conditions leading to a desired closed-loop dissipativity property. Finally, the
  results are illustrated with a simulation example.
