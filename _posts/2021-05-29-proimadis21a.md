title: Learning-based feedforward augmentation for steady state rejection of residual
  dynamics on a nanometer-accurate planar actuator system
abstract: Growing demands in the semiconductor industry result in the need for enhanced
  performance of lithographic equipment. However, position tracking accuracy of high
  precision mechatronics is often limited by the presence of disturbance sources,
  which originate from unmodelled or unforeseen deterministic environmental effects.
  To negate the effects of these disturbances, a learning based feedforward controller
  is employed, where the underlying control policy is estimated from experimental
  data based on Gaussian Process regression. The proposed approach exploits the property
  of including prior knowledge on the expected steady state behaviour of residual
  dynamics in terms of kernel selection. Corresponding hyper-parameters are optimized
  using the maximization of the marginalized likelihood. Consequently, the learned
  function is employed as augmentation of the currently employed rigid body feedforward
  controller. The effectiveness of the augmentation is experimentally validated on
  a magnetically levitated planar motor stage. The results of this paper highlight
  the benefits and possibilities of machine-learning based approaches for compensation
  of static effects, which originate from residual dynamics, such that  position tracking
  performance for moving-magnet planar motor actuators is improved.
