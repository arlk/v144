title: 'Adaptive Sampling for Estimating Distributions: A Bayesian Upper Confidence
  Bound Approach'
abstract: The problem of adaptive sampling for estimating probability mass functions
  (pmf) uniformly well is considered. Performance of the sampling strategy is measured
  in terms of the worst-case mean squared error. A Bayesian variant of the existing
  upper confidence bound (UCB) based approaches is proposed. It is shown analytically
  that the performance of this Bayesian variant is no worse than the existing approaches.
  The posterior distribution on the pmfs in the Bayesian setting allows for a tighter
  computation of upper confidence bounds which leads to significant performance gains
  in practice. Using this approach, adaptive sampling protocols are proposed for estimating
  SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in various groups such as location and ethnicity. The
  effectiveness of this strategy is discussed using data obtained from a seroprevalence
  survey in Los Angeles county.
