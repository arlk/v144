title: Learning local modules in dynamic networks
abstract: Over the last decade, the problem of data-driven modeling in linear dynamic
  networks has been introduced in the literature, and has shown to contain many different
  challenging research questions. The structural and topological properties of networks
  become a central ingredient in the data-driven modeling problem, as well as the
  selection of locations for signals to be sensed and for excitation signals to be
  added. In this survey-type paper we will present an overview of recent results that
  are obtained for the problem of learning the dynamics of a single link/module in
  a dynamic network of which the topology is given. The surveyed methods include extensions
  of classical identification methods, combined with Bayesian kernel-based methods.
  Particular attention will be given to the selection of signals that need to be available
  for measurement/excitation, and accuracy properties of the estimated models in terms
  of consistency and minimum variance properties.
