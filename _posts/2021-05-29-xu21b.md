title: How Are Learned Perception-Based Controllers Impacted by the Limits of Robust
  Control?
abstract: 'The difficulty of optimal control problems has classically been characterized
  in terms of system properties such as minimum eigenvalues of controllability/observability
  gramians. We revisit these characterizations in the context of the increasing popularity
  of data-driven techniques like reinforcement learning (RL) in control settings where
  input observations are high-dimensional images and transition dynamics are not known
  beforehand. Specifically, we ask: to what extent are quantifiable control and perceptual
  difficulty metrics of a control task predictive of the performance of various families
  of data-driven controllers? We modulate two different types of partial observability
  in a cartpole “stick-balancing” problem – the height of one visible fixation point
  on the cartpole, which can be used to tune fundamental limits of performance achievable
  by any controller, and by using depth or RGB image observations of the scene, we
  add different levels of perception noise without affecting system dynamics. In these
  settings, we empirically study two popular families of controllers: RL and system
  identification-based $H_\infty$ control, using visually estimated system state.
  Our results show the fundamental limits of robust control have corresponding implications
  for the sample-efficiency and performance of learned perception-based controllers.'
