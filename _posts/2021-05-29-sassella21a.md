title: Data-driven design of switching reference governors for brake-by-wire applications
abstract: Nowadays, data are ubiquitous in control design and data-driven approaches
  are in constant evolution. By following such a trend, in this paper we propose an
  approach for the direct data-driven design of switching reference governors for
  nonlinear plants and we apply it within a brake-by-wire application. The braking
  system is assumed to be pre-stabilized via a simple unknown controller attaining
  unsatisfactory performance in terms of output tracking and actuator effort. Hence,
  the reference governor is used to improve the overall closed-loop behavior, resulting
  into safer maneuvering. Preliminary results on a simulation setup show the effectiveness
  of the proposed strategy, thus motivating further investigation on the topic.
