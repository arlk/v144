title: 'KPC: Learning-Based Model Predictive Control with Deterministic Guarantees'
abstract: We propose Kernel Predictive Control (KPC), a learning-based predictive
  control strategy that enjoys deterministic guarantees of safety. Noise-corrupted
  samples of the unknown system dynamics are used to learn several models through
  the formalism of non-parametric kernel regression. By treating each prediction step
  individually, we dispense with the need of propagating sets through highly non-linear
  maps, a procedure that often involves multiple conservative approximation steps.
  Finite-sample error bounds are then used to enforce state-feasibility by employing
  an efficient robust formulation. We then present a relaxation strategy that exploits
  on-line data to weaken the optimization problem constraints while preserving safety.
  Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed
  control method.
