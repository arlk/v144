title: Data-Driven Reachability Analysis Using Matrix Zonotopes
abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven reachability analysis approach for
  an unknown control system. Reachability analysis is an essential tool for guaranteeing
  safety properties. However, most current reachability analysis heavily relies on
  the existence of a suitable system model, which is often not directly available
  in practice. We instead propose a reachability analysis approach based on noisy
  data. More specifically, we first provide an algorithm for over-approximating the
  reachable set of a linear time-invariant system using matrix zonotopes. Then we
  introduce an extension for nonlinear systems. We provide theoretical guarantees
  in both cases. Numerical examples show the potential and applicability of the introduced
  methods.
