title: Probabilistic robust linear quadratic regulators with Gaussian processes
abstract: Probabilistic models such as Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful tools
  to learn unknown dynamical systems from data for subsequent use in control design.
  While learning-based control has the potential to yield superior performance in
  demanding applications, robustness to uncertainty remains an important challenge.
  Since Bayesian methods quantify uncertainty of the learning results, it is natural
  to incorporate these uncertainties in a robust design. In contrast to most state-of-the-art
  approaches that consider worst-case estimates, we leverage the learning methods’
  posterior distribution in the controller synthesis. The result is a more informed
  and thus efficient trade-off between performance and robustness. We present a novel
  controller synthesis for linearized GP dynamics that yields robust controllers with
  respect to a probabilistic stability margin. The formulation is based on a recently
  proposed algorithm for linear quadratic control synthesis, which we extend by giving
  probabilistic robustness guarantees in the form of credibility bounds for the system’s
  stability. Comparisons to existing methods based on worst-case and certainty-equivalence
  designs reveal superior performance and robustness properties of the proposed method.
