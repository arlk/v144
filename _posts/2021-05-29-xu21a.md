title: Non-conservative Design of Robust Tracking Controllers Based on Input-output
  Data
abstract: This paper studies worst-case robust optimal tracking using noisy input-output
  data. We utilize  behavioral system theory to represent system trajectories, while
  avoiding explicit system identification. We assume that the recent output data used
  in the data-dependent representation are noisy and we provide a non-conservative
  design procedure for robust control based on optimization  with a linear cost and
  LMI constraints. Our methods rely on the parameterization of noise sequences compatible
  with the data-dependent system representation and on a suitable reformulation of
  the performance specification, which further enable the application of the S-lemma
  to derive an LMI optimization problem. The performance of the new controller is
  discussed through simulations.
