title: Generating Adversarial Disturbances for Controller Verification
abstract: 'We consider the problem of generating maximally adversarial disturbances
  for a given controller assuming only blackbox access to it. We propose an online
  learning approach to this problem that adaptively generates disturbances based on
  control inputs chosen by the controller. The goal of the disturbance generator is
  to minimize regret versus a benchmark disturbance-generating policy class, i.e.,
  to maximize the cost incurred by the controller as well as possible compared to
  the best possible disturbance generator in hindsight (chosen from a benchmark policy
  class). In the setting where the dynamics are linear and the costs are quadratic,
  we formulate our problem as an online trust region (OTR) problem with memory and
  present a new online learning algorithm (MOTR) for this problem. We prove that this
  method competes with the best disturbance generator in hindsight (chosen from a
  rich class of benchmark policies that includes linear-dynamical disturbance generating
  policies). We demonstrate our approach on two simulated examples: (i) synthetically
  generated linear systems, and (ii) generating wind disturbances for the popular
  PX4 controller in the AirSim simulator. On these examples, we demonstrate that our
  approach outperforms several baseline approaches (including H-infinity disturbance
  generation and gradient-based methods).'
