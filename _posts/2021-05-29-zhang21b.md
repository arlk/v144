title: 'LEOC: A Principled Method in Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Classical
  Control Theory'
abstract: There have been attempts in reinforcement learning to exploit a priori knowledge
  about the structure of the system. This paper proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning
  controller which dynamically interpolates a model-based linear controller and an
  arbitrary differentiable policy. The linear controller is designed based on local
  linearised model knowledge, and stabilises the system in a neighbourhood about an
  operating point. The coefficients of interpolation between the two controllers are
  determined by a scaled distance function measuring the distance between the current
  state and the operating point. The overall hybrid controller is proven to maintain
  the stability guarantee around the neighborhood of the operating point and still
  possess the universal function approximation property of the arbitrary non-linear
  policy. Learning has been done on both model-based (PILCO) and model-free (DDPG)
  frameworks. Simulation experiments performed in OpenAI gym demonstrate stability
  and robustness of the proposed hybrid controller. This paper thus introduces a principled
  method allowing for the direct importing of control methodology into reinforcement
  learning.
