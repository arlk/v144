title: Data-Driven System Level Synthesis
abstract: We establish data-driven versions of the System Level Synthesis (SLS) parameterization
  of stabilizing controllers for linear-time-invariant systems.  Inspired by recent
  work in data-driven control that leverages tools from behavioral theory, we show
  that optimization problems over system-responses can be posed using only libraries
  of past system trajectories, without explicitly identifying a system model.  We
  first consider the idealized setting of noise free trajectories, and show an exact
  equivalence between traditional and data-driven SLS.  We then show that in the case
  of a system driven by process noise, tools from robust SLS can be used to characterize
  the effects of noise on closed-loop performance.  We then draw on tools from matrix
  concentration to show that a simple trajectory averaging technique can be used to
  mitigate these effects.  We end with numerical experiments showing the soundness
  of our methods.
