title: Analysis of the Optimization Landscape of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Control
abstract: 'This paper revisits the classical Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control
  from a modern optimization perspective. We analyze two aspects of the optimization
  landscape of the LQG problem: 1) connectivity of the set of stabilizing controllers
  $\mathcal{C}_n$; and 2) structure of stationary points.  It is known that similarity
  transformations do not change the input-output behavior of a dynamical controller
  or LQG cost. This inherent symmetry by similarity transformations makes the landscape
  of LQG very rich. We show that 1) the set of stabilizing controllers $\mathcal{C}_n$
  has at most two path-connected components and they are diffeomorphic under a mapping
  defined by a similarity transformation; 2) there might exist many \emph{strictly
  suboptimal stationary points} of the LQG cost function over $\mathcal{C}_n$ and
  these stationary points are always \emph{non-minimal}; 3) all \emph{minimal} stationary
  points are globally optimal and they are identical up to a similarity transformation.
  These results shed some light on the performance analysis of direct policy gradient
  methods for solving the LQG problem.'
