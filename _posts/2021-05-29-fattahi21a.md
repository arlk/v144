title: Learning Partially Observed Linear Dynamical Systems from Logarithmic Number
  of Samples
abstract: 'In this work, we study the problem of learning partially observed linear
  dynamical systems from a single sample trajectory. A major practical challenge in
  the existing system identification methods is the undesirable dependency of their
  required sample size on the system dimension: roughly speaking, they presume and
  rely on sample sizes that scale linearly with the system dimension. Evidently, in
  high-dimensional regime where the system dimension is large, it may be costly, if
  not impossible, to collect as many samples from the unknown system. In this paper,
  we introduce an regularized estimator that can accurately estimate the Markov parameters
  of the system, provided that the number of samples scale poly-logarithmically with
  the system dimension. Our result significantly improves the sample complexity of
  learning partially observed linear dynamical systems: it shows that the Markov parameters
  of the system can be learned in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of
  samples is significantly smaller than the system dimension.'
