title: 'Nonlinear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Convergence and Finite-Time
  Performance'
abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation, a generalized version of the popular
  stochastic approximation, has found broad applications in many areas including stochastic
  control, optimization, and machine learning. Despite of its popularity, theoretical
  guarantees of this method, especially its finite-time performance, are mostly achieved
  for the linear case while the results for the nonlinear counterpart are very sparse.
  Motivated by the classic control theory for singularly perturbed systems, we study
  in this paper the asymptotic convergence and finite-time analysis of the nonlinear
  two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Under some fairly standard assumptions,
  we provide a formula that characterizes the rate of convergence of the main iterates
  to the desired solutions. In particular, we show that the method achieves a convergence
  in expectation at a rate O(1/k^{2/3}), where k is the number of iterations. The
  key idea in our analysis is to properly choose the two step sizes to  characterize
  the coupling between the fast and slow-time-scale iterates.
