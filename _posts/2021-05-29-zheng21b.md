title: Sample Complexity of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Control for Output Feedback
  Systems
abstract: This paper studies a class of partially observed Linear Quadratic Gaussian
  (LQG) problems with unknown dynamics. We establish an end-to-end sample complexity
  bound on learning a robust LQG controller for open-loop stable plants. This is achieved
  using a robust synthesis procedure, where we first estimate a model from a single
  input-output trajectory of finite length, identify an H-infinity bound on the estimation
  error, and then design a robust controller using the estimated model and its quantified
  uncertainty. Our synthesis procedure leverages a recent control tool called Input-Output
  Parameterization (IOP) that enables robust controller design using convex optimization.
  For open-loop stable systems, we prove that the LQG performance degrades linearly
  with respect to the model estimation error using the proposed synthesis procedure.
  Despite the hidden states in the LQG problem, the achieved scaling matches previous
  results on learning Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers with full state
  observations.
