title: 'When to stop value iteration: stability and near-optimality versus computation'
abstract: " Value iteration (VI) is a ubiquitous algorithm for optimal control, planning,
  and reinforcement learning schemes. Under the right assumptions, VI is a vital tool
  to generate inputs with desirable properties for the controlled system, like optimality
  and Lyapunov stability. As VI usually requires an infinite number of iterations
  to solve general nonlinear optimal control problems, a key question is when to terminate
  the algorithm to produce a “good” solution, with a measurable impact on optimality
  and stability guarantees. By carefully analysing VI under general stabilizability
  and detectability properties, we provide explicit and novel relationships of the
  stopping criterion’s impact on near-optimality, stability and performance, thus
  allowing to tune these desirable properties against the induced computational cost.
  The considered class of stopping criteria encompasses those encountered in the control,
  dynamic programming and reinforcement learning literature and it allows considering
  new ones, which may be useful to further reduce the computational cost while endowing
  and satisfying stability and near-optimality properties. We therefore lay a foundation
  to endow machine learning schemes based on VI with stability and performance guarantees,
  while reducing computational complexity."
