title: Episodic Learning for Safe Bipedal Locomotion with Control Barrier Functions
  and Projection-to-State Safety
abstract: This paper combines episodic learning and control barrier functions (CBFs)
  in the setting of bipedal locomotion. The safety guarantees that CBFs provide are
  only valid with perfect model knowledge; however, this assumption cannot be met
  on hardware platforms. To address this, we utilize the notion of Projection-to-State
  safety paired with a machine learning framework in an attempt to learn the model
  uncertainty as it effects the barrier functions. The proposed approach is demonstrated
  both in simulation and on hardware for the AMBER-3M bipedal robot in the context
  of the stepping-stone problem which requires precise foot placement while walking
  dynamically.
