title: Linear Regression over Networks with Communication Guarantees
abstract: A key functionality of emerging connected autonomous systems such as smart
  cities, smart transportation systems, and the industrial Internet-of-Things, is
  the ability to process and learn from data collected at different physical locations.
  This is increasingly attracting attention under the terms of distributed learning
  and federated learning. However, in connected autonomous systems, data transfer
  takes place over communication networks with often limited resources. This paper
  examines algorithms for communication-efficient learning for linear regression tasks
  by exploiting the informativeness of the data. The developed algorithms enable a
  tradeoff between communication and learning with theoretical performance guarantees
  and efficient practical implementations.
