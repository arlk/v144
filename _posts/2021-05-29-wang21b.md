title: Adaptive Risk Sensitive Model Predictive Control with Stochastic Search
abstract: We present a general framework for optimizing the Conditional Value-at-Risk
  for dynamical systems using stochastic search. The framework is capable of handling
  the uncertainty from the initial condition, stochastic dynamics, and uncertain parameters
  in the model. The algorithm is compared against a risk-sensitive distributional
  reinforcement learning framework and demonstrates improved performance on a pendulum
  and cartpole with stochastic dynamics. We also showcase the applicability of the
  framework to robotics as an adaptive risk-sensitive controller by optimizing with
  respect to the fully nonlinear belief provided by a particle filter on a pendulum,
  cartpole, and quadcopter in simulation.
