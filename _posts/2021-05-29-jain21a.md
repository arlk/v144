title: Optimal Cost Design for Model Predictive Control
abstract: 'Many robotics domains use some form of nonconvex model predictive control
  (MPC) for planning, which sets a reduced time horizon, performs trajectory optimization,
  and replans at every step. The actual task typically requires a much longer horizon
  than is computationally tractable, and is specified via a cost function that cumulates
  over that full horizon. For instance, an autonomous car may have a cost function
  that makes a desired trade-off between efficiency, safety risk, and obeying traffic
  laws. In this work, we challenge the common assumption that the cost we should specify
  for MPC should be the same as the ground truth cost for the task. We propose that,
  because MPC solvers have short horizons, suffer from local optima, and, importantly,
  fail to account for future replanning ability, in many tasks it could be beneficial
  to purposefully choose a different cost function for MPC to optimize: one that results
  in the MPC rollout to have low ground truth cost, rather than the MPC planned trajectory.
  We formalize this as an optimal cost design problem, and propose a zeroth-order
  optimization-based approach that enables us to design optimal costs for an MPC planning
  robot in continuous state and action MDPs. We test our approach in an autonomous
  driving domain where we find costs different from the ground truth that implicitly
  compensate for replanning, short horizon, and local minima issues. As an example,
  planning with vanilla MPC under the learned cost incentivizes the car to delay its
  decision until later, implicitly accounting for the fact that it will get more information
  in the future and be able to make a better decision.'
