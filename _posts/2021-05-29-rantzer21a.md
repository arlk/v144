title: Minimax Adaptive Control for a Finite Set of Linear Systems
abstract: An adaptive controller is derived for linear time-invariant systems with
  uncertain parameters restricted to a finite set, such that the closed loop system
  including the non-linear learning procedure is stable and satisfies a pre-specified
  l2-gain bound from disturbance to error. As a result, robustness to unmodelled (linear
  and non-linear) dynamics follows from the small gain theorem. The approach is based
  on a dynamic zero-sum game formulation with quadratic cost. Explicit upper and lower
  bounds on the optimal value function are stated and a simple formula for an adaptive
  controller achieving the upper bound is given. The controller uses semi-definite
  programming for optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Once the
  uncertain parameters have been sufficiently estimated, the controller behaves like
  standard H-infinity state feedback.
